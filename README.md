# 2SR Agent

> **2SRA (Self-Reconfigurable Roft-Rigid Agent)** is a compact mobile robot capable of that introduces a novel approach to mobile manipulation and navigation. By integrating variable stiffness capabilities, 2SRA can switch between a rigid, omnidirectional mobile platform and a flexible, deformable manipulator. This unique design enables two key functionalities:
> * **Full-Body Grasping:** In its flexible state, 2SRA can envelop and secure objects by conforming its body to their shape. This method of grasping removes the dependency of mobile platforms on dedicated manipulators like arms or grippers, thereby streamlining the robot's design, and reducing both its size and mechanical complexity. After grasping, the robot can revert to a rigid state to transport the object effectively.
> * **Morphology-Aware Navigation:** 2SRA leverages its adaptive morphology to efficiently navigate its environment. When faced with narrow passages or cluttered areas, the robot can reconfigure its shape to squeeze through obstacles that would block a conventional, rigid robot. This capability is a form of embodied intelligence, where the physical structure of the robot is an integral part of its navigation strategy.
>
> By unifying the functions of a robust mobile platform and a deformable manipulator, 2SRA represents a *versatile, minimalist robot* offering a compelling solution for tasks requiring both mobility and dexterity in environments where size and complexity are critical constraints.
