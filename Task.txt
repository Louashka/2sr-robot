1. Extrapolate the constant-curvature (CC) arcs that correspond to VS segments:
    - Open Controler/motive-client.py
    - Insert CC arc calculations instead of the line 100 (robot['k'] = [0.0, 0.0])
    - Segment arc length must be maintained constant (Model/global_var.py -> L_VSS)

2. Add location of the markers to each robot in the method Controler/motive-client.py -> getCurrentConfig(). 
I guess this information can be stored as additional element of the 'robot' dictionary. 
You can consider other options as well.

3. Update the View/plotlib.py in the following way:
    - number of subplots depends on the number of agents (bottom half of the window)
    - each agent must have 3 subplots
        -- one subplot that shows zoomed-in robot (similar to the plotAgent() method); plot markers in the same method and 
           add the display of wheels with their corresponding frames
        -- one subplot that shows the target path, actual path and schematic representation of the agent (no wheels
           markers and frames)
        -- one suplot with error graphs (you can improvise here)
    - add the diplay of the camera view (top half of the window)
        -- add plots of targets and paths on top of the video
